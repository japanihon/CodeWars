INSTRUCTION

Create a method take_while that accepts a list and a block, and returns a array of the first several elements from the list, for as long as the block returns true.

Keep in mind, we don't want all the items for which the block returns true; once we get a false response, we want to stop looking. So this example:

take_while([0,1,2,3,4,5,6]){|item| item.even?}
Will only return [0], not [0,2,4,6].

# SOLUTION

def take_while list, &block
  list.take_while(&block)
end
