Task Overview
Americans are odd people: in their buildings, the first floor is actually the ground floor and there is no 13th floor ('cause of superstition).

Write a function that given an American floor (passed as an integer) returns the real floor.
Moreover, your function should work for basement floors too: just return the same value as the passed one.

Usage Examples:
getRealFloor(1) == 0
getRealFloor(0) == 0 // Special case to please Europeans
getRealFloor(5) == 4
getRealFloor(15) == 13
getRealFloor(-3) == -3

*/

// SOLUTION

const getRealFloor = n => {
  if (n <= 0) {
    return n;
  } else if (n >= 1 && n <= 12) {
    return n - 1;
  } else {
    return n - 2;
  }
};
